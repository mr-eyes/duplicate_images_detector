what changed in this PR:

* changed file structure to match file structure as a package for pip
* refactored configuration reading from a file to a cleaner more generalizable form
* moved all constants defined once up the file and transformed to pythonic constants 
* moved db interaction to a seperate module (change db interaction if required in the future
  ex: use an orm instead of pyodb)
* refactored main module to prepare it to be used as a library inside others python code
* got rid of all subprocess calls (unnessecary overhead on the program)
* structred the webapp to be a seperate module
